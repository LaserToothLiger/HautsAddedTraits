<Patch><!--	Zeal Traits is a solid mod - like 'Traits - Corpse Handling', it does what it sets out to do with minimal fuss. There's just one problem, which is the 'ideoligion thought multiplier'
	stat the mod author added in at some point. As the author points out in a stickied discussion thread, one has to patch in every single ideoligious thought into Zeal Traits in order for the
	multiplier to work on it. Ergo, this patch alters those traits by replacing their ideoligion thought multipliers with my own more robust ideo mood and opinion factors.-->
