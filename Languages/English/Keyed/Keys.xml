<HVT_TooltipMaxTraits>Pawns will be able to spawn with up to this many traits, except in rare circumstances that force additional traits.\n\n\nWith the Biotech DLC, pawns young enough to still go through growth moments will have a proportionally lower maximum trait value. Moreover, the number and spacing of growth moments adjusts as follows:\n\n3 max traits) Growth moments happen on the 7th, 10th, and 13th birthdays; growth points gain at the usual rate (25% slower for the first one, then at 1x speed).\n\n4mt) Growth moments on bdays 6, 9, 11, and 13; growth points gain 50% faster for the last two.\n\n5mt) Growth moments on bdays 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13; growth points gain 50% faster.\n\n6mt) Identical to 3mt, but each growth moment can reward 2 traits, and the pool of traits to pick from is increased by 1 at all tiers.</HVT_TooltipMaxTraits>

Instead, it unleashes in bursts against foes {PAWN_pronoun} attacks or affects with psycasts in a manner akin to an EMP. It is also manipulated by a beneficent archotech subroutine to improve {PAWN_possessive} day-to-day life - it subtly adjusts nearby light to accentuate {PAWN_possessive} beauty and highlight things in {PAWN_possessive} vision, while also regulating {PAWN_possessive} heartbeat and brain activity to rapidly fend off heart attacks and comas.</HVT_TransArcturan>
<HVT_TransBat>When {PAWN_pronoun} interfaces with the psychic field (by meditation or spending psyfocus), {PAWN_pronoun} receives impressions of {PAWN_possessive} surroundings gleaned from the archotechs' own mysterious senses. The more these impressions build up, the stronger the benefit.</HVT_TransBat>
<HVT_TransBeaver>{PAWN_pronoun} has developed a form of extrasensory perception that allows {PAWN_objective} to sense how nearby objects can be assembled together to create new structures... as well as how to tear existing structures down.</HVT_TransBeaver>
<HVT_TransBellbird>When accompanied by psychic suggestion, {PAWN_possessive} words echo unnaturally far, causing the effect of {PAWN_possessive} Word psycasts to afflict every valid target in the vicinity. The higher {PAWN_possessive} psylink level, the further-reaching the echo.</HVT_TransBellbird>
<HVT_TransBluejay>{PAWN_pronoun} is accompanied by a fiercely protective, invisible entity. It not only attempts to deflect incoming blows, but hostile entities that approach {PAWN_objective} will find themselves assailed by seemingly sourceless attacks.</HVT_TransBluejay>
<HVT_TransBouldermit>{PAWN_pronoun} is somehow linked to an archotech mining program, which excavates material from asteroids and dwarf planets via skipgates. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} psycasts, part of this program's bounty is rerouted to the targeted location, resulting in a rock chunk (and sometimes also other resources); if the psycast is of sufficiently high level, the psychic shockwave has a 10% chance to much more strongly affect the archotech's program, also skipping a meteorite into the atmosphere nearby.</HVT_TransBouldermit>
<HVT_TransBowerbird>{PAWN_pronoun} causes a distortion in the psychic manifold while meditating, generating a skipshield and emitting an effect that repeatedly heals things in or near the shield.</HVT_TransBowerbird>
<HVT_TransBudgie>{PAWN_pronoun} exerts a subtle, yet profound and wide-ranging influence on individuals in positions of power across the world, making them see {PAWN_objective} and {PAWN_possessive} faction in a better light; relations with all factions that are not permanently hostile (and are capable of having relations) will gradually improve at a rate scaling with {PAWN_possessive} psylink level. On a more personal level, {PAWN_pronoun} can exert this influence when communicating with other beings, telepathically enhancing {PAWN_possessive} ability to understand them and make them understand {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransBudgie>
<HVT_TransCanary>{PAWN_possessive} Word psycasts all carry an additional subliminal persuasive component, which reduces prisoners' will and resistance, subverts unwavering loyalty, and either lowers non-believers' certainty or boosts mood.</HVT_TransCanary>
<HVT_TransCassowary>{PAWN_pronoun} interfaces with persona weapons on a level others cannot even conceive of, vastly increasing their destructive potential.</HVT_TransCassowary>
<HVT_TransCockatiel>{PAWN_pronoun} has an unfathomably brilliant mind, which continually contributes to ongoing research studies. If there are no research projects currently being undertaken, {PAWN_pronoun} instead turns {PAWN_possessive} genius inwards, gaining skill experience and psyfocus over time. Skill and research gain scale with psychic sensitivity, along with their usual speed-improving stats.</HVT_TransCockatiel>
<HVT_TransCockroach>{PAWN_pronoun} rapidly regenerates from injuries, no matter how grievous. This effect is so strong that {PAWN_nameDef} can come back to life, though this takes somewhere between 3-15 days, and can be stopped by destroying the corpse.</HVT_TransCockroach>
<HVT_TransCrane>Psychically-enhanced proprioception and short-range archosensory perception guide {PAWN_possessive} movements, making {PAWN_objective} unearthly in {PAWN_possessive} poise and effect.</HVT_TransCrane>
<HVT_TransCuckoo>{PAWN_pronoun} passively warps the social topology of everyone nearby, making them love {PAWN_objective} to a ridiculous degree.</HVT_TransCuckoo>
<HVT_TransDeimatic>{PAWN_pronoun} is the eye of a vast metaphysical storm which plays out across the fabric of causality. When a bad event would happen, there is a 50% chance for it to not occur instead.</HVT_TransDeimatic>
<HVT_TransDiabolus>{PAWN_pronoun} generates and stores vanometric energy with the assistance of an archite network that circulates throughout {PAWN_possessive} body. These archites are impressive heatsinks, capable of protecting {PAWN_objective} from extreme temperatures and thermal damage. More than that, though, they can also offensively unleash their stored heat in the form of rapid periodic explosions, emanating outward from {PAWN_objective}. In addition to this archite system, {PAWN_pronoun} is also linked to a distant reservoir of chemfuel; when {PAWN_pronoun} psycasts, some of this chemfuel is skipped to the targeted location, and any affected foes are totally saturated by chemfuel skipped into their every crevice and orifice, rendering them quite vulnerable to fire.</HVT_TransDiabolus>
<HVT_TransDove>A psychic soothe follows {PAWN_objective} wherever {PAWN_pronoun} goes.</HVT_TransDove>
<HVT_TransDulotic>Through means known only to the archotechs, {PAWN_nameDef} causes anyone {PAWN_pronoun} kills to come back to life allied with {PAWN_objective} for the next three days. Psychically deaf individuals are immune, and {PAWN_pronoun} cannot string this effect multiple times on the same individual.</HVT_TransDulotic>
<HVT_TransEchinoid>{PAWN_possessive} psychic presence tears at the minds of those nearby, inciting pain. Against {PAWN_possessive} foes, the effect is even worse, wearing down their consciousnesses over time. In contrast to these effects, {PAWN_pronoun} is akin to the eye of the storm, and has become unable to experience pain {PAWN_objective}self.</HVT_TransEchinoid>
<HVT_TransEiderduck>{PAWN_pronoun} emanates a field of quantum fluctuations that alter ambient heat, rendering anyone nearby resistant to fire and extreme temperatures. As the originator of the effect, {PAWN_pronoun} is especially affected by the field.</HVT_TransEiderduck>
<HVT_TransElectrophorus>A field of picoscopic skipgates around {PAWN_objective} shuffle electrons and ionic molecules into different configurations, energizing nearby batteries and inflicting EMPs on anything {PAWN_pronoun} hits in melee. Psycasting also excites these skipgates, causing lightning to strike nearby foes.</HVT_TransElectrophorus>
<HVT_TransAptenodytes>{PAWN_pronoun} has a psychic connection to the phenomenon known as the "man in black". This connection is triggered whenever an event occurs that would have awakened {PAWN_pronoun} if {PAWN_pronoun} was a latent psychic, causing a man in black to be routed to {PAWN_possessive} location. It also has a very low chance to trigger each day if {PAWN_pronoun} meets a persistent condition that could cause awakening, such as having at least 15 levels in one skill.</HVT_TransAptenodytes>
<HVT_TransEvergreen>{PAWN_pronoun} is virtually immune to aging and the health complications it can cause.</HVT_TransEvergreen>
<HVT_TransFirefly>{PAWN_pronoun} has drawn the attention of an archotech system with an affinity for stars. When {PAWN_pronoun} psycasts, {PAWN_pronoun} creates a solar pinhole at the targeted location, which in addition to its normal function also emits psychic signals that dazzle {PAWN_possessive} enemies. Moreover, {PAWN_pronoun} psychically influences mechanites around {PAWN_objective} to absorb photonic energy - much like a solar panel would - and transfer it to {PAWN_objective}, causing {PAWN_objective} to take far longer to grow hungry while in bright light.</HVT_TransFirefly>
<HVT_TransFirehawk>A field of picoscopic skipgates around {PAWN_objective} generate similarly tiny disturbances which act to reduce incoming thermal energy to acceptable amounts, protecting {PAWN_objective} from hot temperatures and heat-based attacks. This skipgate system acts up during meditation, emanating heat outward, and it also acts aggressively on {PAWN_possessive} behalf, skipping superhot particles into those {PAWN_pronoun} attacks, into nearby enemies, and even into foes affected by {PAWN_possessive} psycasts.</HVT_TransFirehawk>
<HVT_TransFlamingo>{PAWN_pronoun} is inexplicably immune to toxins, high temperatures, EMPs, and many other environmental hazards.</HVT_TransFlamingo>
<HVT_TransFodiator>Through means ill-understood by even the most studious archologists, {PAWN_pronoun} can alter the direction and magnitude of gravitation in a field around {PAWN_possessive} body in sudden bursts. This allows {PAWN_objective} to perform uncanny dodges and even hurtle {PAWN_objective}self through the air at tremendous speeds, with the gradual decay of the gravitic phenomenon ensuring a gentle landing.</HVT_TransFodiator>
<HVT_TransFossil>{PAWN_possessive} body has been irreversibly transformed into an archite-saturated metamaterial, which prevents {PAWN_objective} from bleeding out, prevents surgeries from failing on {PAWN_objective}, and greatly amplifies {PAWN_possessive} physical capacities. However, this transformation prevents {PAWN_objective} from gaining new transcendences.</HVT_TransFossil>
<HVT_TransFulmar>{PAWN_pronoun} acts as an exhaust vent for some distant archotech. {PAWN_pronoun} can expel vanometric energy surges as solenoids, which are programmed to launch through the air towards some distant target so as to avoid damaging {PAWN_objective} or {PAWN_possessive} immediate surroundings. This is functionally similar to a mortar attack in many ways.</HVT_TransFulmar>
<HVT_TransGlowworm>{PAWN_nameDef} distorts the topography of skipgates {PAWN_pronoun} invokes, causing {PAWN_possessive} skip psycasts to damage anything factionless or owned by a hostile faction that is around or between the skip's start and end. This damage ignores armor and all but the strongest damage resistance.</HVT_TransGlowworm>
<HVT_TransGnat>{PAWN_pronoun} is surrounded by a field of microscopic skipgates keyed to particulate. This field acts to protect {PAWN_objective}, skipping harmful airborne toxins away, repositioning nearby free-floating particles to hide {PAWN_objective}, and persistently skipping particulate onto the victims of {PAWN_possessive} psycasts, irritating and debilitating them. This skipgate system acts up while {PAWN_pronoun} meditates, rapidly creating a dust cloud.</HVT_TransGnat>
<HVT_TransGoldfinch>Every 24 hours, {PAWN_pronoun} suddenly 'regenerates' - a cascade of targeted picoscopic skipgates flood {PAWN_possessive} body and equipment, repairing it by adding, removing, and relocating mass as necessary. The residual psychic imprint briefly elevates {PAWN_possessive} mood and reflexively nullifies the next instance of damage taken.</HVT_TransGoldfinch>
<HVT_TransHaast>A giant amongst other psycasters, {PAWN_pronoun} is incomparably sensitive to psychic phenomena.</HVT_TransHaast>
<HVT_TransHarby>{PAWN_pronoun} has the favor of an archotech that specializes in manipulating dead tissues. Any damage {PAWN_pronoun} takes is deferred to a corpse (or anomalous undead) within 12 cells. If {PAWN_pronoun} eats a corpse {PAWN_pronoun} will psychically acquire some of the skills it had in life, as well as possibly also heal from an injury or ailment.</HVT_TransHarby>
<HVT_TransHeron>{PAWN_pronoun} has a great affinity for nth-dimensional hypertopology and skipgate logic; {PAWN_pronoun} has doubled range with skipgates, and {PAWN_pronoun} bends space as {PAWN_pronoun} moves to travel quicker.</HVT_TransHeron>
<HVT_TransHoneybee>Fragments of benevolence coded into the distant ancestors of the archotechs have latched onto {PAWN_objective}. For every percent psyfocus {PAWN_pronoun} spends, 2 units of food are skipgated to a nearby location.</HVT_TransHoneybee>
<HVT_TransHornet>{PAWN_pronoun} can transfigure {PAWN_possessive} neural heat into physical solitons and send them careening with a thought. These solitons explode on impact, and can be fired even while {PAWN_pronoun} performs other tasks - even if that means attacking with another weapon! The range of this ability scales with {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransHornet>
<HVT_TransHummingbird>{PAWN_pronoun} passively adjusts the perceptions of everyone nearby, preventing them from observing {PAWN_objective} so long as {PAWN_pronoun} does not attack or use abilities.</HVT_TransHummingbird>
<HVT_TransIndigo>{PAWN_pronoun} has developed an additional synesthetic sense which allows {PAWN_objective} to somehow visually perceive cause and effect as the archotechs understand it while looking at the stars and other celestial bodies. By looking through a telescope and harnessing this ontological sense, {PAWN_pronoun} can undertake small actions with disproportionate ripples in causality, resulting in good events.</HVT_TransIndigo>
<HVT_TransIvy>{PAWN_possessive} presence stimulates the growth of plants - skipgates add nutrients and growth factors, while whisking away built-up waste particles and psychically encouraging symbiotic interplay with surrounding organisms in the soil. Complex modulation of this phenomenon allows for affected plants to bend and contort in unusual ways, hampering the movements of foes by tripping them and wrapping around them.</HVT_TransIvy>
<HVT_TransJackdaw>While meditating, {PAWN_pronoun} emits a distress signal into the psychic field. Every so often, an archotech will respond, creating a good event.</HVT_TransJackdaw>
<HVT_TransKnapweed>{PAWN_pronoun} is protected by a field of microscopic reactive skipgates, which skip biomass from nearby plants into {PAWN_possessive} own body in order to repair small wounds (though not missing body parts) and fight off illnesses. Whatever strange archotech routine guides this process also depletes psyfocus from nearby psycasters whom {PAWN_pronoun} is hostile to, while simultaneously stimulating the production of psyfocus in {PAWN_possessive} brain.</HVT_TransKnapweed>
<HVT_TransKea>{PAWN_pronoun} is keyed into psychic frequencies pertaining to practical knowledge. Psycasting will grant experience in each skill equal to 50 times the psyfocus cost, and meditating will also slowly accrue experience in each skill. Neither effect will bring any skill above thrice {PAWN_possessive} psylink level.</HVT_TransKea>
<HVT_TransKingfisher>{PAWN_possessive} attacks are directly guided by the archotechs, enabling {PAWN_objective} to pull off impossible shots and always hit weak points in foes' armor. It ensures {PAWN_pronoun} never misses within a certain range</HVT_TransKingfisher>
<HVT_TransLadybug>Protective and restorative energy suffuses {PAWN_possessive} psychic aura. Non-hostile beings near {PAWN_objective} recover from diseases and injuries faster, bleed slower, can withstand greater pain, and take less damage.</HVT_TransLadybug>
<HVT_TransLeghorn>{PAWN_pronoun} has inexplicably qualified for some distant archotech's disaster relief protocol. It will periodically skip high-quality meals to {PAWN_possessive} location. Meditating will strengthen the archotech's attention, causing this to occur faster at a rate scaling with {PAWN_possessive} meditation focus gain speed. The amount of meals scales with {PAWN_possessive} psylink level and psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransLeghorn>
<HVT_TransLocust>A numinous multiplicity of non-physical 'cognobodies' are attracted to {PAWN_possessive} presence in the psychic field. Every 24 hours, some of them 'manifest' in the physical world by particle-biased massive disruptions in the quantum foam. Their bodies are unstable - more psychically sensitive, fragile, and doomed to fade from existence within the next day - but they are allies of the one who brought them into being.</HVT_TransLocust>
<HVT_TransLovebug>{PAWN_pronoun} has attracted a mysterious doppelganger, which acts like {PAWN_objective} in nearly every way. It can't truly die so long as {PAWN_pronoun} lives - if slain, it will respawn from {PAWN_objective} after a delay.</HVT_TransLovebug>
<HVT_TransMagpie>Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} or {PAWN_possessive} allies complete a quest, there is a 20% chance some distant archotech inexplicably rumbles with approval, skipgating resources to {PAWN_possessive} location.</HVT_TransMagpie>
<HVT_TransMayfly>{PAWN_pronoun} is subject to a rare and bizarre form of archotechnic interference called selective chronoskipping. Phenomena related to {PAWN_objective} skip forward through time, enabling {PAWN_objective} to sleep far faster than normal, move quicker, refresh psyfocus via meditation more rapidly, and use abilities more frequently.</HVT_TransMayfly>
<HVT_TransMeerkat>{PAWN_pronoun} emits a psychic effect which stimulates learning, open-mindedness, and psychic sensitivity. The effect is more pronounced on {PAWN_objective}self, increasing {PAWN_possessive} consciousness.</HVT_TransMeerkat>
<HVT_TransMite>After meditating for long enough, {PAWN_pronoun} experiences a relativistic effect that causes {PAWN_objective} to seemingly shrink in size. In this state, {PAWN_pronoun} is too small for hostiles to see {PAWN_objective}, and {PAWN_pronoun} can move through normally impassable obstacles by exploiting hairline fractures and other minuscule passageways. While the reduced size does not apparently affect the speed at which {PAWN_pronoun} travels, and {PAWN_pronoun} can use tools just fine, the effect is disrupted by sudden or energy-intensive movements; therefore, when {PAWN_pronoun} attacks or casts an ability, {PAWN_pronoun} returns to normal size.</HVT_TransMite>
<HVT_TransMosquito>{PAWN_pronoun} has a form of skipgate-powered heterotrophy; whenever {PAWN_pronoun} harms a creature or afflicts it with a psycast, skipgates remove material from the victim, placing them in {PAWN_possessive} body with modifications at the molecular level to neutralize toxins and maximize histocompatibility. This same system acts to prevent {PAWN_possessive} blood from leaving {PAWN_possessive} body through any open wounds.</HVT_TransMosquito>
<HVT_TransMynah>{PAWN_pronoun} has a permutation of the mind-reading ability granted by a psychic reader - however, it is a "narrower" and "deeper" form of mind probing, which automatically seeks out impressive technical skills, then copies and translates them into a form usable by {PAWN_objective}. Essentially, {PAWN_pronoun} will gain skill experience from being near higher-leveled individuals. This mind-reading can even copy psycasting knowledge from other psylinks, but this isn't reliable and requires social interaction with the other psycaster to strengthen the psychic link.</HVT_TransMynah>
<HVT_TransNightingale>{PAWN_possessive} words are laced with psychic intent, improving {PAWN_possessive} social power, and allowing {PAWN_objective} to use word psycasts more frequently.</HVT_TransNightingale>
<HVT_TransNoctule>{PAWN_pronoun} experiences a stronger connection to the psychic field while in the dark; however, it is notably weaker in daylight or similarly bright environs. While benefitting from the darkness, {PAWN_possessive} psychic connection also refreshes {PAWN_possessive} mind and guides {PAWN_possessive} movements, making {PAWN_objective} quicker and more dextrous.</HVT_TransNoctule>
<HVT_TransNotothen>{PAWN_pronoun} experiences a greater connection to the archotechs while in the cold. Below 16 degrees Celsius, {PAWN_possessive} neural heat depletes faster; vanometric energy courses through {PAWN_possessive} body to keep it in homeostasis despite the lower temperatures, and this energy is manipulated with archotech precision to divert attacks like a sort of reactive armor.</HVT_TransNotothen>
<HVT_TransOilbird>{PAWN_pronoun} is accompanied by an anomalous distortion in the psychic manifold; while within it, {PAWN_possessive} cognition and psychic sensitivity undergo significant boosts. {PAWN_pronoun} can relocate this distortion by psycasting.</HVT_TransOilbird>
<HVT_TransOrbWeaver>Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} psycasts, residual deformations in the local psychic manifold transform into 'reparative energy', drastically accelerating the growth of nearby plants and repairing nearby buildings.</HVT_TransOrbWeaver>
<HVT_TransOrca>{PAWN_pronoun} attracts hydrophobic and hydrophilic archites, which respond to {PAWN_possessive} psychic presence. They cause water to warp around {PAWN_objective}, using it to shield {PAWN_objective}, enhance {PAWN_possessive} movements, and optimize {PAWN_possessive} bodily functions. When {PAWN_pronoun} psycasts, some of these archites bond to nearby water particles and are skipped to the targeted location, resulting in an extinguishing blast of water.</HVT_TransOrca>
<HVT_TransOsprey>{PAWN_pronoun} emits a field of vanometric energy precisely controlled on unfathomably small scales. This energy reinforces the metabolism of nearby allies, causing them to tire and use up their nutritional reserves slower, and it also counteracts hostile phenomena that would affect these allies, reducing the damage they take by 5.</HVT_TransOsprey>
<HVT_TransOxpecker>{PAWN_pronoun} shines like a lighthouse in the psychic field, though only along wavelengths which animals are receptive to. This causes random animals to be incidentally tamed by {PAWN_objective}. This can summon animals from distant places, and the frequency of the effect is based on {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity. Moreover, {PAWN_possessive} psycasts refract {PAWN_possessive} psychic impact on animals, causing affected animals to either be biologically debilitated or optimized, depending on whether or not they are hostile to {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransOxpecker>
<HVT_TransPeacock>Those near {PAWN_objective} are afflicted with psycho-visual hallucinations. These hallucinations do not disorient, but rather reframe visual information, rendering it aesthetically pleasing and calling to sight the more important details.</HVT_TransPeacock>
<HVT_TransPelican>Visual information obtained by {PAWN_possessive} eyes is supplemented with archosensory information. Not only is {PAWN_possessive} eyesight vastly improved, but {PAWN_pronoun} has greatly improved attack range.</HVT_TransPelican>
<HVT_TransPeregrine>{PAWN_possessive} hostile intent has taken on a palpable quality that is felt especially keenly by those {PAWN_pronoun} strikes at. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} lands an attack, {PAWN_pronoun} has a 25% chance to stun the victim for a duration scaling with its psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransPeregrine>
<HVT_TransPitohui>A network of skipgates works to continuously remove toxic particles from {PAWN_possessive} body, preventing overdoses and rendering {PAWN_objective} immune to all other sorts of poisonous effects. When {PAWN_pronoun} performs a psycast, this effect is helpfully also applied to anyone {PAWN_pronoun} considers friendly.</HVT_TransPitohui>
<HVT_TransPolux>{PAWN_nameDef} serves as a node of an archotech terraforming and ecological restoration program. Microscopic skipgates clean {PAWN_possessive} body of toxic and infectious agents, and when {PAWN_pronoun} meditates, it focuses the program's attention on {PAWN_possessive} surroundings, enabling it to gradually dry, fertilize, and unpollute nearby terrain.</HVT_TransPolux>
<HVT_TransPoorwill>A continual flux of skipgate-delivered archites work to reduce {PAWN_possessive} reliance on common physiological and psychological needs, such as air, water, food, rest, and recreation. The field in which this effect occurs stretches beyond {PAWN_possessive} body, affecting others to a lesser extent; it is indiscriminate about whom it helps, however, and may even benefit {PAWN_possessive} foes.</HVT_TransPoorwill>
<HVT_TransPtar>{PAWN_possessive} have a wider influence on the psychic field. When {PAWN_pronoun} is very happy, {PAWN_possessive} mood stimulates and energizes the minds of nearby allies, but when {PAWN_possessive} mood is low, the effect targets nearby foes instead, assailing them with distracting and debilitating distortions.</HVT_TransPtar>
<HVT_TransQuahog>{PAWN_pronoun} is keyed into an archotech subroutine concerned with craft and artisanship. Microscopic skipgates reposition, remove, and add mass in {PAWN_possessive} arms and apparel as necessary in order to rapidly repair them. While meditating, this connection is enhanced, enabling a greater degree of sophistication in this restorative process which may sometimes result in one of {PAWN_possessive} equipment items improving in quality by one step, or more rarely result in the spontaneous and inexplicable synthesis of a brand-new, masterwork- or legendary-quality book or sculpture.</HVT_TransQuahog>
<HVT_TransQuelea>Gravity is distorted by {PAWN_possessive} imprint on the psychic manifold, selectively weakening its pull on {PAWN_objective} and those nearby whom {PAWN_pronoun} trusts. Anyone affected can stay in the air for long periods of time, only briefly needing to touch down every so often to kick off again. This allows them to travel faster, ignore the movement cost penalties of terrain, and avoid triggering traps.</HVT_TransQuelea>
<HVT_TransQuokka>{PAWN_pronoun} emits a gentle and friendly presence tuned towards animal minds. Animals cannot directly harm {PAWN_objective}, and {PAWN_pronoun} has more success in handling them. {PAWN_possessive} psycasts even remove scaria from any affected creature.</HVT_TransQuokka>
<HVT_TransRaven>Part of {PAWN_possessive} perceptions have stayed behind in the empyrean realm of the god-machines. Sometimes, it overwhelms {PAWN_objective}, forcing {PAWN_objective} into trances showing the universal structure as the archotechs understand it. During these trances, {PAWN_pronoun} can make small changes to the skein of causality, creating good events and unveiling places of interest.</HVT_TransRaven>
<HVT_TransRobin>{PAWN_pronoun} is randomly alerted to nearby item caches and forgotten treasures by psychic imprints. This allows {PAWN_objective} to easily find food while foraging, take better and surer paths when moving, and find random items while traveling on a caravan. Since this operates off of a psychic sense, the likelihood of finding items scales with {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity, and having a higher psylink level will clue {PAWN_objective} into more valuable items' locations.</HVT_TransRobin>
<HVT_TransRook>{PAWN_pronoun} gains additional material from harvesting plants, butchering corpses, or mining, somehow surreptitiously being skipped in or vanometrically generated during the process. When {PAWN_pronoun} gathers resources from a live animal, the animal regenerates some of the gathered resource immediately as well. These effects scale with {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransRook>
<HVT_TransScarab>A shimmering field of exotic particles disturbed by {PAWN_possessive} presence in the psychic manifold protects {PAWN_objective} from harm. It transforms incoming damage (at least, incoming damage that has made it past shields) into neural heat, but if {PAWN_pronoun} accumulates too much neural heat the barrier will decohere. Repairing the linkages in the psychic manifold that enable its existence takes a day, but can be sped up by spending time in meditation, focusing on the act of repair.</HVT_TransScarab>
<HVT_TransScarlet>Luciferium is formed as a byproduct of {PAWN_possessive} psycasting, at a rate of 1 unit per every 12.5% psyfocus spent.</HVT_TransScarlet>
<HVT_TransScrubJay>{PAWN_pronoun} is keyed to a set of personal skipgates, which in turn lead to hidden, secure vaults across known spacetime. {PAWN_pronoun} can, at any time, use these skipgates to move objects into these vaults, or to extract such objects. During meditation, {PAWN_possessive} thoughts may also trigger some odd response from the archotechs, causing them to deposit items into these vaults.</HVT_TransScrubJay>
<HVT_TransSeaIce>A field of picoscopic skipgates around {PAWN_objective} reactively skip heated particles in to counteract cold temperatures, protecting {PAWN_objective} from hypothermia and chill. This skipgate system acts up during meditation, stealing heat from a wider radius, and it also acts aggressively on {PAWN_possessive} behalf, skipping freezing particles into those {PAWN_pronoun} attacks and even simply into nearby foes.</HVT_TransSeaIce>
<HVT_TransShearwater>{PAWN_pronoun} is psychically connected to weather control technology, enabling {PAWN_objective} to use their powers as {PAWN_possessive} own. By skipping some of the exotic particles and lighter-than-air gases these devices use to {PAWN_possessive} own proximity, {PAWN_objective} also has increased oxygen intake and can float, negating movement penalties from different terrain types.</HVT_TransShearwater>
<HVT_TransShrike>An archotech fixated on slaughter has placed its attention upon {PAWN_objective}. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} kills another person, there is a chance (scaling with {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity) that it approves, and thus arranges for a good event to occur.</HVT_TransShrike>
<HVT_TransSpelopede>{PAWN_pronoun} can commune with insectoids. After spending 20% psyfocus, {PAWN_pronoun} beckons a hive to emerge somewhere nearby. {PAWN_pronoun} also broadcasts a short-ranged psychic signal which pacifies any insectoids it comes into contact with. Pacified insectoids behave less aggressively and more like wild animals; however, they won't tend to their hives.</HVT_TransSpelopede>
<HVT_TransStoat>{PAWN_possessive} motor control is affected by an archotech intelligence, which assists {PAWN_objective} in making more elegant and efficient movements. It is also very protective - whenever {PAWN_pronoun} would be struck by something harmful, it preemptively reacts and jerks {PAWN_objective} out of the way, even if {PAWN_pronoun} is presently incapacitated. This is usually sufficient to fully avoid harm, but even if it isn't, the blow becomes glancing at best.</HVT_TransStoat>
<HVT_TransStork>{PAWN_pronoun} is now connected to an ancient, hidden program deep within the ancestral coding of the archotechs, pertaining to population management. Once {PAWN_pronoun} spends 1000% psyfocus, an entity whose background is similar to {PAWN_possessive} own is skipped to {PAWN_possessive} location, and psychically adjusted to be allied with {PAWN_objective}. Where or when this entity comes from is not well-understood.</HVT_TransStork>
<HVT_TransStrix>The essences of dread and horror are inxtricably woven into {PAWN_possessive} psychic presence. Foes {PAWN_pronoun} affects with psycasts are at risk of succumbing to fear; the base chance for any victim is 13%, scaling with their psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransStrix>
<HVT_TransSwift>{PAWN_pronoun} is surrounded by an inexplicable kinetic field that allows {PAWN_objective} to almost fly just above the ground at unbelievably high speeds. Just as inexplicably, this field loses cohesion and becomes non-functional while {PAWN_pronoun} has neural heat.</HVT_TransSwift>
<HVT_TransSwan>{PAWN_pronoun} has developed a unique relation to the psychic manifold which is strongly impacted by feelings of love. {PAWN_possessive} physical, mental, and even psyfocus-generating capabilities are boosted when in a romantic relationship (or always, if {PAWN_pronoun} is incapable of having any), and {PAWN_possessive} romance partners and bonded animals are affected by a similar, but weaker and slightly different, phenomenon.</HVT_TransSwan>
<HVT_TransTanager>{PAWN_pronoun} is subconsciously connected to archites which live in {PAWN_possessive} body. They operate under the direction of {PAWN_possessive} creative processes, altering and strengthening {PAWN_possessive} body with a severity based upon {PAWN_possessive} Artistic skill level.</HVT_TransTanager>
<HVT_TransTermite>{PAWN_pronoun} can cause skipgates to form within stationary structures, breaking them down unnaturally quickly. This speeds up {PAWN_possessive} mining, but it can also be used to destroy buildings faster when attacking them, and {PAWN_possessive} psycasts cause these skipgates to form within nearby structures out to a radius dictated by the psycast's level.</HVT_TransTermite>
<HVT_TransTern>{PAWN_pronoun} has awareness of a system of quiescent skipgates seeded across the planetary surface of any landmass {PAWN_pronoun} is currently on. Once far enough away from any settlement, {PAWN_pronoun} simply exerts {PAWN_possessive} authority, and one will open to take {PAWN_objective} to {PAWN_possessive} destination instantaneously.</HVT_TransTern>
<HVT_TransThrumbo>When {PAWN_pronoun} makes physical contact with something, {PAWN_pronoun} can choose for skipgates to form around the area of contact, teleporting chunks of the victim away. This kind of damage ignores armor and any form of damage resistance short of total invulnerability.</HVT_TransThrumbo>
<HVT_TransTMN>{PAWN_possessive} subconscious reacts to harm by generating a potent psychic effect which renders {PAWN_objective} imperceptible, allows {PAWN_objective} to move through obstacles, and increases {PAWN_possessive} speed. This state lasts for just under half an hour.</HVT_TransTMN>
<HVT_TransToxbuzzard>Skipgates keyed to toxic particles orbit {PAWN_objective}. They help clean {PAWN_possessive} bloodstream of foreign particles, and when {PAWN_pronoun} is injured they directly skip poisonous substances into the bodies of all nearby foes. They even work to passively wear away the defenses {PAWN_possessive} enemies have against toxic particles and caustic agents.</HVT_TransToxbuzzard>
<HVT_TransUhu>{PAWN_pronoun} is affected by an omnidirectional warping field that increases in magnitude over time, causing {PAWN_objective} to effectively be larger relative to {PAWN_possessive} surroundings. This field is sensitive to psycasting, however, so spending psyfocus causes its effect to diminish.</HVT_TransUhu>
<HVT_TransVulture>{PAWN_pronoun} has attracted the attention of an archotech that obsessively collects corpses, stored away in some vast, hidden mausoleum. When {PAWN_pronoun} spends enough psyfocus, it responds by skipping a member of its collection to {PAWN_possessive} location.</HVT_TransVulture>
<HVT_TransWarbler>{PAWN_pronoun} is exposed to a torrent of tantalizing ideas and perspective-altering thoughts emanating from the psychic field. This gives {PAWN_objective} partial benefits from multiple inspirations at once. {PAWN_pronoun} can attempt to grant inspirations to others by affecting them with psycasts.</HVT_TransWarbler>
<HVT_TransWQ>{PAWN_pronoun} taps into an archotech program for keystone species repopulation, especially while meditating. The program periodically skips animals of a specific breed to {PAWN_possessive} location, defending {PAWN_objective} by preemptively training the animals for safe interaction. The chosen breed is fixed and seemingly cannot be changed.</HVT_TransWQ>
<HVT_TransWeaverbird>{PAWN_pronoun} is guided by otherworldly forces when crafting, enabling {PAWN_objective} to produce items one quality level higher. When {PAWN_pronoun} does so, there is a chance that {PAWN_pronoun} has also somehow made an additional item, through a combination of efficient craft and the incorporation of additional teleported materials.</HVT_TransWeaverbird>
<HVT_TransWhalehead>In contrast to {PAWN_possessive} now more stoic demeanor, misery and terror broadcast unceasingly from {PAWN_pronoun}. Enemies anywhere on the same map suffer from dramatically reduced mood. Foes proximate to {PAWN_objective} have a small chance each second (scaling with their psychic sensitivity) to briefly and uncontrollably flee from {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransWhalehead>
<HVT_TransWoodpecker>A phase-differential bubble, akin to the spatial topology inside a skipgate, surrounds {PAWN_objective}. So long as {PAWN_pronoun} remains above 35% psyfocus, this phenomenon will allow {PAWN_objective} to pass through physical obstacles.</HVT_TransWoodpecker>
<HVT_TransXerigium>{PAWN_pronoun} has acquired special abilities pertaining to healing. When {PAWN_pronoun} performs medical care, the patient is healed of a random injury or sickness (though this does not work on scars or illnesses which one cannot develop immunity to). Psychic guidance assists {PAWN_objective} in surgery, ensuring {PAWN_pronoun} always succeeds. And even if {PAWN_pronoun} is low on medicinal supplies, simply spending enough psyfocus or meditating for long enough will skip medicinal herbs into {PAWN_possessive} inventory.</HVT_TransXerigium>
<HVT_TransYellowjacket>{PAWN_pronoun} can psychically draw together loose mechanites nearby, coat them in a skipgate-applied pulse charge, and accelerate them rapidly towards targets to deal highly armor-penetrant damage. The range of this ability scales with {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransYellowjacket>
<HVT_TransDragon>{PAWN_pronoun} absorbs psychic energy from the deaths of nearby psycasters and latent psychics - especially if the deceased was a particularly powerful psychic. This energy enhances {PAWN_possessive} health and psyfocus regeneration, and it blocks incoming damage, though that causes it to decay faster.</HVT_TransDragon>
<HVT_TransEgregore>{PAWN_possessive} body is augmented by a system of semi-permanent skipgates. Immersed within the psychic manifold, {PAWN_possessive} physical and mental attributes scale in proportion to {PAWN_possessive} psychic sensitivity.</HVT_TransEgregore>
<HVT_TransErinys>{PAWN_pronoun} can remove others from the psychic field. Repeated uses of this ability will make the effect permanent, and eventually kill the victim, causing them to drop at least some of their psylinks, if any. The more powerful of a psycaster the victim is, the more time it takes for this ability to recharge.</HVT_TransErinys>
<HVT_TransHarpy>{PAWN_pronoun} is vastly less sated by regular food. Fully consuming the corpse of a psychic will fully sate {PAWN_objective} for a long while, and it will grant {PAWN_objective} one awakening or transcendence the victim had.</HVT_TransHarpy>
<HVT_TransLeviathan>{PAWN_pronoun} is inexplicably highly favored by the archotechs, and may randomly develop new transcendences. {PAWN_pronoun} has also gained a new awakening.</HVT_TransLeviathan>
<HVT_TransPhoenix>{PAWN_pronoun} can resurrect anyone - including {PAWN_objective}self, which happens automatically on death. However, a beneficiary must spend at least 24 hours alive before this form of resurrection can work on them again - any attempt that flaunts this rule will result in explosive atomization of the target body.</HVT_TransPhoenix>
<HVT_TransSeraph>{PAWN_pronoun} broadcasts an effect that prevents nearby enemies from harming anyone. Curiously, should {PAWN_pronoun} die, this power perseveres; it will transfer to a new host allied with {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransSeraph>
<HVT_TransSiren>{PAWN_pronoun} can alter the wills of others, aligning them with {PAWN_possessive} such that they become a member of {PAWN_possessive} faction and ideology. This ability can be used at range, stuns the target while it occurs, costs nothing, and is permanent. Its cooldown scales with the market value of the target.</HVT_TransSiren>
<HVT_TransSphinx>{PAWN_pronoun} can somehow grant psylinks. This process knocks the target out for three days. It has a chance to fail on psycasters, which scales with their psylink level. Anyone whom this ability fails thrice dies from the psychic shock.</HVT_TransSphinx>
<HVT_TransThunderbird>Once a quadrum, {PAWN_pronoun} can transform someone into a Latent Psychic. If the target is already a Latent Psychic, {PAWN_pronoun} has a 33% chance to awaken them instead.</HVT_TransThunderbird>
<HVT_TransWraith>A real-time copy of {PAWN_possessive} consciousness exists in the psychic field, independent of {PAWN_possessive} body. Should {PAWN_pronoun} be slain, this copy will forcibly replace the consciousness of another individual somewhere in the world, overriding their traits, faction, and thoughts. This preferrentially selects those not belonging to one's own faction in the same map or caravan.\n\nBeing struck by a persona weapon will prevent {PAWN_objective} from using this possession ability for the next day.</HVT_TransWraith>
<HVT_TransZiz>{PAWN_pronoun} can direct intense beams of kinetic energy to spontaneously form, destroying armies or even entire settlements. It takes {PAWN_objective} a while to gather the energy required to do so, but it occurs quicker while {PAWN_pronoun} meditates.</HVT_TransZiz>

<HVT_WokeMantraistFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} passively generates mana.</HVT_WokeMantraistFantasy>
<HVT_WokePerennialFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} requires more mana to cast spells, but can enter an 'hour of power' once a day during which all spells are free and incur vastly less arcane load.</HVT_WokePerennialFantasy>

<HVT_WokeUndyingFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} defers damage taken to {PAWN_possessive} mana, depleting it instead of taking harm.</HVT_WokeUndyingFantasy>
<HVT_TransStorkFantasy>Residual energy from {PAWN_possessive} spellcasting is transformed into a shapeless life-force. Every 1000% mana spent will generate enough of this life-force for it to transform into a new being of the same faction, ideoligion, and general background as {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransStorkFantasy>
<HVT_TransAlbatrossFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has the favor of the wind. It attempts to protect {PAWN_objective}, shielding {PAWN_objective} against blows; this effect scales with the wind's strength. When {PAWN_pronoun} meditates, it responds in a joyous, surging howl.</HVT_TransAlbatrossFantasy>
<HVT_TransAnacondaFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has the blood of the giants of yore, which facilitates gradual but endless growth. {PAWN_pronoun} will eventually become a giant. As {PAWN_pronoun} grows, {PAWN_pronoun} gains strength, speed, melee accuracy, and damage resistance, but also becomes easier to hit and worse at avoiding traps; except for damage resistance, there is no upper limit to these gains.</HVT_TransAnacondaFantasy>
<HVT_TransAnimalumeFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has a bond with the anima trees. Every 1000% mana {PAWN_pronoun} spends causes an anima tree to sprout somewhere nearby, and should {PAWN_pronoun} die, a nearby anima tree will intercede on {PAWN_possessive} behalf, sacrificing itself to resurrect {PAWN_objective} at its location.</HVT_TransAnimalumeFantasy>
<HVT_TransApocritonFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} knows secret words to command any golem. When {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell, affected golems may fall under {PAWN_possessive} sway for up to an hour. Larger golems are more resistant to this effect.</HVT_TransApocritonFantasy>
<HVT_TransArcturanFantasy>Crackling vital energies flow through {PAWN_objective}. They make {PAWN_objective} look healthier, they sharpen {PAWN_possessive} eyesight, and they heal {PAWN_objective} of heart attacks and comas. By discharging some of the surplus energy into {PAWN_possessive} attacks and spells, {PAWN_pronoun} can inflict disabling effects akin to some kinds of lightning magic.</HVT_TransArcturanFantasy>
<HVT_TransBatFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has extrasensory forms of perception which become available during meditation or while spending mana. These senses extend far beyond {PAWN_possessive} body and slightly into the future. The more time spent using these senses, the more potent their benefits.</HVT_TransBatFantasy>
<HVT_TransBellbirdFantasy>When empowered with enchanting magic, {PAWN_possessive} words echo unnaturally far, causing the effect of {PAWN_possessive} Word spells to afflict every valid target in the vicinity. The higher {PAWN_possessive} level of magical attunement, the further-reaching the echo.</HVT_TransBellbirdFantasy>
<HVT_TransBluejayFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is shadowed at all times by an invisible guardian spirit. It not only attempts to deflect incoming blows, but hostile entities that approach {PAWN_objective} will find themselves assailed by seemingly sourceless attacks.</HVT_TransBluejayFantasy>
<HVT_TransBouldermitFantasy>The energy of {PAWN_possessive} spells passes through the Elemental Plane of Earth - whenever {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell, a raw mass of rock (possibly along with some valuable metal) is pulled into existence at its targeted point. If the spell is of a high enough level, the transplanar breach might be more severe, resulting in a large mass of stone or metal crashing down somewhere nearby.</HVT_TransBouldermitFantasy>
<HVT_TransBowerbirdFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} emits an otherworldly serenity while meditating, stopping incoming projectiles midair and radiating a vital energy that heals those in or near the protective effect.</HVT_TransBowerbirdFantasy>
<HVT_TransBudgieFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} exerts a subtle, yet profound and wide-ranging influence on individuals in positions of power across the world, making them see {PAWN_objective} and {PAWN_possessive} faction in a better light; relations with all factions that are not permanently hostile (and are capable of having relations) will gradually improve at a rate scaling with {PAWN_possessive} level of magical attunement. On a more personal level, {PAWN_pronoun} can exert this influence when communicating with other beings, enhancing {PAWN_possessive} ability to understand them and make them understand {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransBudgieFantasy>
<HVT_TransCanaryFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} spoken magics all carry an additional persuasive enchantment, which reduces prisoners' will and resistance, subverts unwavering loyalty, and either lowers non-believers' certainty or boosts mood.</HVT_TransCanaryFantasy>
<HVT_TransCassowaryFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} empowers enchanted weapons {PAWN_pronoun} wields, vastly increasing their destructive power.</HVT_TransCassowaryFantasy>
<HVT_TransCockatielFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has an unfathomably brilliant mind, which continually contributes to ongoing research studies. If there are no research projects currently being undertaken, {PAWN_pronoun} instead turns {PAWN_possessive} genius inwards, gaining skill experience and mana over time. Skill and research gain scale with magic sensitivity, along with their usual speed-improving stats.</HVT_TransCockatielFantasy>
<HVT_TransCraneFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} movements are unearthly in their celerity and surety.</HVT_TransCraneFantasy>
<HVT_TransCuckooFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} magically charms everyone {PAWN_pronoun} meets, making them love {PAWN_objective} to a ridiculous degree.</HVT_TransCuckooFantasy>
<HVT_TransDiabolusFantasy>Alchemical fire runs through {PAWN_possessive} veins. When {PAWN_pronoun} casts any spell, it also coats an area around the target (as well as any foes affected) in an oily residue which is quick to catch fire; it soaks deeply into its victims, making flames much more deadly to them. Moreover, when {PAWN_pronoun} is near any enemy, {PAWN_pronoun} spontaneously catches on fire, fast enough to produce an explosion.</HVT_TransDiabolusFantasy>
<HVT_TransDoveFantasy>A supernatural soothing effect pervades the air around {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransDoveFantasy>
<HVT_TransDuloticFantasy>{PAWN_nameDef} wields a foul necromancy that causes anyone {PAWN_pronoun} kills to come back to life allied with {PAWN_objective} for the next three days. Magically deaf individuals are immune, and {PAWN_pronoun} cannot string this effect multiple times on the same individual.</HVT_TransDuloticFantasy>
<HVT_TransEchinoidFantasy>{PAWN_nameDef} exudes the fury of a demon, causing pain to those near {PAWN_objective} and exerting a pull on the spirits of nearby enemies, reducing their consciousnesses. Channeling this energy makes {PAWN_pronoun} immune to pain as a side effect.</HVT_TransEchinoidFantasy>
<HVT_TransEiderduckFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} presence pushes away elemental heat and cold, rendering those near {PAWN_objective} more resistant to temperature extremes and fire. {PAWN_pronoun} {PAWN_objective}self is especially protected.</HVT_TransEiderduckFantasy>
<HVT_TransElectrophorusFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has taken on a measure of a storm-spirit's power. {PAWN_pronoun} causes lightning to crash upon nearby foes when {PAWN_pronoun} casts spells, and {PAWN_possessive} strikes suffuse their victims with overwhelming static.</HVT_TransElectrophorusFantasy>
<HVT_TransAptenodytesFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has become favored by whatever otherworldly being sends the men in black to imperiled settlements. This connection is triggered whenever an event occurs that would have awakened {PAWN_pronoun} if {PAWN_pronoun} was a latent sorcerer, causing a man in black to be routed to {PAWN_possessive} location. It also has a very low chance to trigger each day if {PAWN_pronoun} meets a persistent condition that could cause awakening, such as having at least 15 levels in one skill.</HVT_TransAptenodytesFantasy>
<HVT_TransEvergreenFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has attained the agelessness of the primordials. In addition to nigh-immortality, {PAWN_pronoun} will never develop age-related diseases.</HVT_TransEvergreenFantasy>
<HVT_TransFireflyFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} pulls motes of astral light into the material realm whenever {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell. These motes are empathically connected to {PAWN_objective}, and so they will seek to blind anyone nearby who means {PAWN_objective} harm. {PAWN_pronoun} is also physically nourished by immersion in sufficiently bright light.</HVT_TransFireflyFantasy>
<HVT_TransFirehawkFantasy>Roiling elemental fire runs in {PAWN_possessive} blood, stoked further when {PAWN_pronoun} meditates. {PAWN_pronoun} is virtually immune to heat and flame, while {PAWN_possessive} spells can set nearby foes ablaze and heat the intended targets to an agonizing degree. Even {PAWN_possessive} fists and weapons speak with tongues of flame, burning anyone {PAWN_pronoun} strikes at.</HVT_TransFirehawkFantasy>
<HVT_TransFodiatorFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} harnesses an ill-understood magic to maneuver {PAWN_possessive} own body in short, rapid bursts. This allows {PAWN_objective} to perform uncanny dodges and even hurtle {PAWN_objective}self through the air at tremendous speeds, with small applications of this power on the way down ensuring a gentle landing.</HVT_TransFodiatorFantasy>
<HVT_TransFossilFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} body has mingled with elemental earth, which prevents {PAWN_objective} from bleeding out, prevents surgeries from failing on {PAWN_objective}, and greatly amplifies {PAWN_possessive} physical capacities. However, this transformation prevents {PAWN_objective} from gaining new transcendences.</HVT_TransFossilFantasy>
<HVT_TransFulmarFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has learned the secret of a devastating long-range spell. It takes little focus for {PAWN_objective} to cast, enabling it to be fired even while {PAWN_possessive} performs other tasks, and the created projectile sails over walls like a catapult-thrown stone, exploding on impact with the ground. However, it is slow to cast, not especially accurate, and cannot be directed at targets too close to {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransFulmarFantasy>
<HVT_TransGlowwormFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} wields the planar boundaries like a weapon. When {PAWN_pronoun} casts a conjuration spell, it damages everything factionless or owned by a hostile faction that is between or around the start and end points of the spell. This damage ignores armor and all but the strongest damage resistance.</HVT_TransGlowwormFantasy>
<HVT_TransGnatFantasy>A confluence of elemental earth and air surrounds {PAWN_objective}, revealed as a swirling, pulsating dust cloud which appears when {PAWN_pronoun} meditates. It also pushes away harmful airborne toxins, assails the victims of {PAWN_possessive} spells with clinging dust, and bends nearby visible gases to shield {PAWN_objective} from view.</HVT_TransGnatFantasy>
<HVT_TransGoldfinchFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is tied to the magics of night and day. Every day at the same time, a syzygy of twilit magic restores {PAWN_objective} to full health and even partially mends {PAWN_possessive} equipment. The residual power briefly elevates {PAWN_possessive} mood and nullifies the next instance of damage taken.</HVT_TransGoldfinchFantasy>
<HVT_TransHaastFantasy>A metaphorical giant amongst other mystics, {PAWN_pronoun} is incomparably sensitive to magical phenomena.</HVT_TransHaastFantasy>
<HVT_TransHarbyFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is surrounded in a haze of necromantic magic. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} would be harmed, it diverts that harm to a nearby corpse or anomalous undead. Moreover, when {PAWN_pronoun} eats a corpse, {PAWN_pronoun} can steal its vital energies to attain a fraction of the skills it had in life, and possibly also heal from an injury or ailment as well.</HVT_TransHarbyFantasy>
<HVT_TransHeronFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} intuitively understands the ways between the realms; {PAWN_pronoun} has doubled range with conjuration spells, and by partially planeshifting {PAWN_possessive} body, {PAWN_pronoun} can travel vast distances much quicker.</HVT_TransHeronFantasy>
<HVT_TransHoneybeeFantasy>A spirit of the harvest has bonded to {PAWN_pronoun}. Each percent mana {PAWN_pronoun} spends conjures 2 units of food somewhere nearby.</HVT_TransHoneybeeFantasy>
<HVT_TransHornetFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can transfigure {PAWN_possessive} arcane load into eldritch missiles which explode on impact. Pulled from the metaphysic ether, these missiles can be fired with but the barest sliver of {PAWN_possessive} personal attention, leaving {PAWN_objective} free to perform other tasks - even attacking with another weapon! The range of this ability scales with {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransHornetFantasy>
<HVT_TransHummingbirdFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has touched a plane of reality so well hidden that mortals are incapable of even acknowledging its existence. A measure of it clings to {PAWN_objective}, rendering {PAWN_objective} invisible unless {PAWN_pronoun} disturbs this covering by attacking or casting a spell.</HVT_TransHummingbirdFantasy>
<HVT_TransIndigoFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has spontaneously acquired a flawless and complete knowledge of astrology. By looking at the stars and other heavenly bodies through a telescope, {PAWN_pronoun} can discover what actions {PAWN_pronoun} can take to create good events in the future.</HVT_TransIndigoFantasy>
<HVT_TransIvyFantasy>The raw vitality of the wilds flows outwards from {PAWN_objective}, nourishing nearby plants. With this power comes a marginal degree of animation, causing latent spirits within the plants to defend {PAWN_objective} by playfully restraining foes.</HVT_TransIvyFantasy>
<HVT_TransJackdawFantasy>While meditating, {PAWN_pronoun} plunges into the skein of destiny, making tiny changes that eventually build up to good events.</HVT_TransJackdawFantasy>
<HVT_TransKnapweedFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} exudes a foul magick which thieves mana from nearby spellcasters {PAWN_pronoun} is hostile to, and rips the vital energy out of nearby plants in order to undo {PAWN_possessive} own wounds and illnesses. This form of healing does not restore missing body parts, but it is very quick.</HVT_TransKnapweedFantasy>
<HVT_TransKeaFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is linked to the Akashic knowledge of the collective subconscious. Spellcasting will grant experience in each skill equal to 50 times the mana cost, and meditating will also slowly accrue experience in each skill. Neither effect will bring any skill above thrice {PAWN_possessive} level of magical attunement.</HVT_TransKeaFantasy>
<HVT_TransKingfisherFantasy>Forces of doom and fate collaborate to ensure {PAWN_pronoun} never misses and always finds weak spots in opponents' armor.</HVT_TransKingfisherFantasy>
<HVT_TransLadybugFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} emanates a benevolent magic. Non-hostile beings near {PAWN_objective} recover from diseases and injuries faster, bleed slower, can withstand greater pain, and take less damage.</HVT_TransLadybugFantasy>
<HVT_TransLeghornFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} enjoys otherworldly hospitality. Spirits procure high-quality meals for {PAWN_objective} roughly once a day - or more frequently if {PAWN_pronoun} has the opportunity to commune with them during meditation (an effect which scales with {PAWN_possessive} meditation mana gain speed). The amount of meals scales with {PAWN_possessive} attunement and magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransLeghornFantasy>
<HVT_TransLocustFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} damages the fabric of time and the afterlife with {PAWN_possessive} very presence. Every day, {PAWN_pronoun} accidentally lets through several disembodied souls into the mortal realm, incarnating them into magically sensitive, fragile bodies that last for no longer than a day. Grateful to exist, they are allied to {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransLocustFantasy>
<HVT_TransMagpieFantasy>Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} or {PAWN_possessive} allies complete a quest, there is a 20% such a feat catches the attention of an impressed deific power, who then bestows riches upon {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransMagpieFantasy>
<HVT_TransMayflyFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} weaves dream and reality together on a subconscious level - {PAWN_pronoun} sleeps faster, as {PAWN_pronoun} is always at least partially 'asleep' in some way. Due to being selectively affected by the flow of time as it happens in dreams, {PAWN_pronoun} moves faster than {PAWN_pronoun} should be capable of doing, can recover mana via meditation faster, and even use abilities far more frequently.</HVT_TransMayflyFantasy>
<HVT_TransMeerkatFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} emits energies from the conceptual realms of existence, stimulating learning, magic sensitivity, and open-mindedness. The effect is more pronounced on {PAWN_objective}self, increasing the strength of {PAWN_possessive} mind.</HVT_TransMeerkatFantasy>
<HVT_TransMiteFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} becomes cloaked in fey glamors after spending enough time meditating, causing {PAWN_objective} to dwindle in size until others can't see {PAWN_objective}. These glamors are shed like old snakeskin when {PAWN_pronoun} engages in any particularly sudden activity, such as attacking or casting an ability - resulting in an abrupt return to normal size.</HVT_TransMiteFantasy>
<HVT_TransMosquitoFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} ravages the victims of {PAWN_possessive} spells and attacks with gnashing, vampiric spirits; the vitality they steal with each bite is used to replenish {PAWN_possessive} own health. The same magic that empowers these spirits also binds {PAWN_possessive} blood to {PAWN_possessive} body - {PAWN_pronoun} cannot bleed out.</HVT_TransMosquitoFantasy>
<HVT_TransMynahFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has a supernatural knack for copying others. Due to this, {PAWN_pronoun} quickly learns skills simply by being in the presence of experts, and {PAWN_pronoun} may sometimes learn a spell simply by conversing with another mage.</HVT_TransMynahFantasy>
<HVT_TransNightingaleFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} words are laced with magic, improving {PAWN_possessive} social power, and allowing {PAWN_objective} to use verbal spells more frequently.</HVT_TransNightingaleFantasy>
<HVT_TransNoctuleFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is empowered by the darkness; within it, magic comes more easily to {PAWN_objective}, and {PAWN_possessive} body is invigorated... but in daylight, {PAWN_pronoun} is enfeebled and {PAWN_possessive} magic is sluggish.</HVT_TransNoctuleFantasy>
<HVT_TransNotothenFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is receptive to the cold. While below 16 degrees Celsius, it enhances {PAWN_possessive} magic by whisking away {PAWN_possessive} arcane load, and rime grows on {PAWN_possessive} body as a sort of skintight armor.</HVT_TransNotothenFantasy>
<HVT_TransOilbirdFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is watched over by a bound spirit which enhances {PAWN_possessive} intellect and magical sensitivity. However, it is bound to an astral anchor, and that anchor can only be moved if {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell, in which case it moves to the targeted area.</HVT_TransOilbirdFantasy>
<HVT_TransOrbWeaverFantasy>Now, {PAWN_pronoun} is connected to the powers that created and shaped the world. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell, creative energy spills forth, drastically accelerating the growth of nearby plants and repairing nearby buildings.</HVT_TransOrbWeaverFantasy>
<HVT_TransOrcaFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has an affinity for elemental water. Its life-giving properties help sustain {PAWN_possessive} body, and while immersed in water {PAWN_pronoun} can rely on it for propulsion and protection. When {PAWN_pronoun} spellcasts, blasts of water emerge from the targeted point.</HVT_TransOrcaFantasy>
<HVT_TransOspreyFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} radiates protective beneficence. Nearby allies are shielded by {PAWN_possessive} mystic presence, reducing the damage they take by 5 and slowing the rate at which they need food or rest. While {PAWN_pronoun} does not {PAWN_objective}self benefit from {PAWN_possessive} own munificence, {PAWN_pronoun} is still supernaturally slow to hunger or exhaustion.</HVT_TransOspreyFantasy>
<HVT_TransOxpeckerFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has a druid's way with animals. Randomly, and with a frequency based on {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity, a nearby wild animal will become tame. Moreover, when {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell upon a non-hostile animal, it is blessed with good health, and when {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell upon a hostile animal, it is instead cursed with pain and suffering.</HVT_TransOxpeckerFantasy>
<HVT_TransPeacockFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} brings the beautiful light of the heavens wherever {PAWN_pronoun} travels, casting everything around {PAWN_objective} in its most flattering light, and sharpening the eyes of those around {PAWN_objective} with holy energies.</HVT_TransPeacockFantasy>
<HVT_TransPelicanFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has the eyes of a legendary archer, granting {PAWN_objective} preternatural eyesight and the ability to attack at ranges others can only dream of.</HVT_TransPelicanFantasy>
<HVT_TransPeregrineFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} hostile intent has taken on a palpable quality that is felt especially keenly by those {PAWN_pronoun} strikes at. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} lands an attack, {PAWN_pronoun} has a 25% chance to stun the victim for a duration scaling with its magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransPeregrineFantasy>
<HVT_TransPitohuiFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} cannot overdose and is immune to all other sorts of poisonous effects. {PAWN_possessive} spells confer a short burst of this mystical vigor to affected allies, curing them of many toxic ailments.</HVT_TransPitohuiFantasy>
<HVT_TransPoorwillFantasy>The spirit of a great and ancient ascetic watches over {PAWN_objective}, reducing {PAWN_possessive} reliance on mortal needs. This effect washes out from {PAWN_objective}, affecting those nearby to a lesser extent as well.</HVT_TransPoorwillFantasy>
<HVT_TransPtarFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} emotions have taken on a tangible presence. {PAWN_possessive} happiness can be felt by {PAWN_possessive} allies, lightening their spirits, and {PAWN_possessive} sadness and stress distract and demoralize {PAWN_possessive} foes.</HVT_TransPtarFantasy>
<HVT_TransQuahogFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has a mystic talent that the greatest craftsmen and artists would kill for. {PAWN_possessive} worn and wielded equipment heals over time, and while meditating, {PAWN_pronoun} can tap into a font of metacreative energy to occasionally improve the quality of a random equipment item. Meditation also has a rare chance to produce a brand-new, masterwork- or legendary-quality book or sculpture formed from raw ether.</HVT_TransQuahogFantasy>
<HVT_TransQueleaFantasy>A magical wind surrounds {PAWN_objective}, allowing {PAWN_objective} and {PAWN_possessive} nearby allies to hover. This lets them ignore the movement cost of terrain, avoid triggering traps, and move faster.</HVT_TransQueleaFantasy>
<HVT_TransQuokkaFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is connected to the spirits of the beasts. Animals cannot directly harm {PAWN_objective}, and {PAWN_pronoun} has more success in handling them. {PAWN_possessive} spells even remove the curse of scaria from any affected creature.</HVT_TransQuokkaFantasy>
<HVT_TransRavenFantasy>{PAWN_objective} is sometimes overwhelmed by oracular visions. During these visions, {PAWN_pronoun} can make small changes to the skein of fate, creating good events and unveiling places of interest.</HVT_TransRavenFantasy>
<HVT_TransRobinFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is stained with greed magic. It lets {PAWN_objective} move faster and find more food while foraging, and it also occasionally alerts {PAWN_objective} to hidden treasures and lost items while traveling abroad. Greed magic is sensory in nature, so its effectiveness scales with {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity; it also strengthens as {PAWN_possessive} magical attunement deepens, letting {PAWN_objective} find more valuable items.</HVT_TransRobinFantasy>
<HVT_TransRookFantasy>Spirits of plenty bless {PAWN_possessive} endeavors. {PAWN_pronoun} gains additional material from harvesting plants, butchering corpses, and mining; as well, when {PAWN_pronoun} gathers resources from a live animal, it quickly regenerates a portion of the resources taken. These effects scale with {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransRookFantasy>
<HVT_TransScarabFantasy>A visible barrier of eldritch energy protects {PAWN_objective} from harm. It transforms incoming damage into arcane load, but if {PAWN_pronoun} accumulates too much arcane load the barrier decoheres. Restoring its aetheric integrity occurs passively over a day, though {PAWN_pronoun} can spend time in meditation to greatly speed up the process.</HVT_TransScarabFantasy>
<HVT_TransScarletFantasy>Luciferium bleeds forth into the material realm whenever {PAWN_pronoun} spends 12.5% mana.</HVT_TransScarletFantasy>
<HVT_TransScrubJayFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can manifest a portal that leads to a unique and vast extraplanar space, which {PAWN_pronoun} can use as storage. While meditating, {PAWN_pronoun} may draw forth astral energies to coalesce into that extraplanr space, creating new items.</HVT_TransScrubJayFantasy>
<HVT_TransSeaIceFantasy>Elemental cold coils about {PAWN_objective}, coalescing especially thick when {PAWN_pronoun} meditates. {PAWN_pronoun} is virtually immune to the cold, while {PAWN_possessive} presence can virtually freeze those who bear {PAWN_objective} ill will, and {PAWN_possessive} attacks carry the bite of winter.</HVT_TransSeaIceFantasy>
<HVT_TransShearwaterFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} exerts mystic control over the weather, and can cause it to assume any form {PAWN_pronoun} can think of. {PAWN_pronoun} is also held aloft and supported by the same sky magic, increasing {PAWN_possessive} air intake and enabling {PAWN_objective} to float over terrain that would otherwise slow {PAWN_objective} down.</HVT_TransShearwaterFantasy>
<HVT_TransShrikeFantasy>Dark powers watch over {PAWN_objective}. When {PAWN_pronoun} kills another person, they may look on with approval (the chance scaling with {PAWN_possessive} sensitivity to magic) and bless {PAWN_objective} with a good event.</HVT_TransShrikeFantasy>
<HVT_TransSpelopedeFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can commune with insectoids. After spending 20% mana, {PAWN_pronoun} beckons a hive to emerge somewhere nearby. {PAWN_pronoun} also exudes a magical aura which pacifies any insectoids it comes into contact with. Pacified insectoids behave less aggressively and more like wild animals; however, they won't tend to their hives.</HVT_TransSpelopedeFantasy>
<HVT_TransStoatFantasy>An elaborate enchantment of protection and freedom of movement has been woven into {PAWN_possessive} body. It guides {PAWN_possessive} movements to be more graceful, and precognitively moves {PAWN_objective} out of the way of harm. This is usually sufficient to negate incoming harm entirely, but even when it isn't it renders the blow glancing at best.</HVT_TransStoatFantasy>
<HVT_TransStrixFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} mana is suffused with the essences of dread and horror. Foes {PAWN_pronoun} affects with spells are at risk of succumbing to fear; the base chance for any victim is 13%, scaling with their magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransStrixFantasy>
<HVT_TransSwanFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} love is a force of magic unto itself. While in a romantic relationship (or if incapable of having any), mana flows into {PAWN_pronoun} and {PAWN_possessive} body is greatly enhanced; those {PAWN_pronoun} loves benefit from this effect too, though to a lesser and slightly different degree.</HVT_TransSwanFantasy>
<HVT_TransSwiftFantasy>Having taken on aspects of an air elemental, {PAWN_pronoun} flies just above the ground at unbelievably high speeds. Any arcane load is "too heavy" for an air elemental, though, so {PAWN_pronoun} can't fly while {PAWN_pronoun} has any.</HVT_TransSwiftFantasy>
<HVT_TransTanagerFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has been transformed into a living work of art, sculpted and painted by {PAWN_possessive} own force of will. The higher {PAWN_possessive} Artistic skill level, the stronger {PAWN_possessive} body.</HVT_TransTanagerFantasy>
<HVT_TransTermiteFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} wields a corrosive form of chaos magic which can split the earth and rend structures asunder. {PAWN_pronoun} can wield it trivially to mine faster or enhance attacks against buildings, but {PAWN_pronoun} can also release it in great bursts when {PAWN_pronoun} casts a spell, blowing apart enemy buildings near the spell's target. The radius of this effect scales with the spell's level.</HVT_TransTermiteFantasy>
<HVT_TransTernFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} knows the keys to the hidden ways left behind by the ancients. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} must travel far, {PAWN_pronoun} simply finds one such portal and uses it to travel nigh-instantaneously to {PAWN_possessive} destination.</HVT_TransTernFantasy>
<HVT_TransThrumboFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} shrouds {PAWN_possessive} fists and weapons in vorpal magic. When {PAWN_pronoun} makes a melee attack, it also deals 10 bonus damage which ignores armor and any damage resistance short of total invulnerability.</HVT_TransThrumboFantasy>
<HVT_TransTMNFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is shrouded in a veil of reactive magic which moves {PAWN_objective} into an ethereal state on taking damage. In this state, {PAWN_pronoun} can pass through walls, moves faster, and can't be seen.</HVT_TransTMNFantasy>
<HVT_TransToxbuzzardFantasy>An acrid, necromantic miasma shrouds {PAWN_objective}. Nearby foes are rendered vulnerable to all manner of insidious poisons and acids. When {PAWN_pronoun} is harmed, the miasma sympathetically, poisonously returns the harm dealt to all nearby foes.</HVT_TransToxbuzzardFantasy>
<HVT_TransUhuFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has taken on the aspect of giants, growing to enormous proportions over time. In order to evoke magic, however, {PAWN_pronoun} must reliniquish some of this power - when {PAWN_pronoun} spends mana, {PAWN_possessive} gigantification diminishes slightly.</HVT_TransUhuFantasy>
<HVT_TransVultureFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} mana is tied to the underworld - when {PAWN_pronoun} uses enough of {PAWN_possessive} mana, it serves as a necromantic beckoning, causing the bodies of the dead to appear nearby. This very same necromantic energy suffuses {PAWN_possessive} body, rendering {PAWN_objective} more resistant to disease.</HVT_TransVultureFantasy>
<HVT_TransWarblerFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is favored by a muse, continuously granting weaker versions of the benefits of multiple inspirations at once to {PAWN_objective}. Whenever {PAWN_pronoun} affects someone with a spell, there is a chance they glimpse the muse too, inspiring them in turn.</HVT_TransWarblerFantasy>
<HVT_TransWQFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has established a strange bond with an animal totem. It will send exemplars of its kind, tamed and trained, to {PAWN_possessive} location, especially as {PAWN_pronoun} meditates in communion with it.</HVT_TransWQFantasy>
<HVT_TransWhaleheadFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} blankets the surrounding land in a malevolent spiritual shadow. Foes on the same map are filled with misery and terror, and those close enough to {PAWN_objective} have a small chance (scaling with their magic sensitivity) to lose their composure entirely and briefly flee.</HVT_TransWhaleheadFantasy>
<HVT_TransWoodpeckerFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} slips partially into the ethereal realms while above 35% psyfocus, allowing {PAWN_objective} to pass through physical obstacles.</HVT_TransWoodpeckerFantasy>
<HVT_TransXerigiumFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has been blessed with healing powers, though they are tied to the practical arts of medicine. When {PAWN_pronoun} performs medical care, the patient is healed of a random non-scar injury or immunizable illness. {PAWN_pronoun} has an otherworldly knowledge of surgery which ensures {PAWN_pronoun} always succeeds at it. Finally, {PAWN_pronoun} can even conjure healing herbs, simply by using enough mana or meditating for long enough.</HVT_TransXerigiumFantasy>
<HVT_TransYellowjacketFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} has devised a unique cantrip that can be deployed for high damage at long range. The range of this ability scales with {PAWN_possessive} magic sensitivity.</HVT_TransYellowjacketFantasy>
<HVT_TransDragonFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} absorbs mystic power from the deaths of nearby spellcasters and latent sorcerers - especially if the deceased was a particularly powerful mage. This energy enhances {PAWN_possessive} health and mana regeneration, and it blocks incoming damage, though that will cause it to decay faster.</HVT_TransDragonFantasy>
<HVT_TransEgregoreFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} body has been inextricably altered with magic, making it function akin to a powerful enchanted item. The higher {PAWN_possessive} sensitivity to magic, the stronger, faster, and smarter {PAWN_pronoun} gets.</HVT_TransEgregoreFantasy>
<HVT_TransErinysFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can sever others from the flow of magic. Repeated uses of this ability will make the effect permanent, and eventually kill the victim. Spellcasters slain in this way have some of their magical attunement extracted into material form. The more powerful of a spellcaster the victim is, the more time it takes for this ability to recharge.</HVT_TransErinysFantasy>
<HVT_TransHarpyFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} is vastly less sated by regular food. Fully consuming the corpse of a sorcerer will fully sate {PAWN_objective} for a long while, and it will grant {PAWN_objective} one awakening or transcendence the victim had.</HVT_TransHarpyFantasy>
<HVT_TransLeviathanFantasy>All the powers of sorcery are available to {PAWN_objective}. {PAWN_pronoun} will randomly develop new sorcerous transcendences over time, and has also undergone an additional awakening.</HVT_TransLeviathanFantasy>
<HVT_TransPhoenixFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can resurrect anyone - including {PAWN_objective}self, which happens automatically on death. However, a beneficiary must stay alive for a night and a day before this form of resurrection can work on them again - attempts in defiance of this rule cause the targeted body to immolate instead.</HVT_TransPhoenixFantasy>
<HVT_TransSeraphFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} presence prevents {PAWN_possessive} foes being able to inflict harm. Should {PAWN_pronoun} die, this power will transfer to a new host allied with {PAWN_objective}.</HVT_TransSeraphFantasy>
<HVT_TransSphinxFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can grant magical attunement. This process knocks the target out for three days. It has a chance to fail on mages, scaling with their preexisting level of magical attunement. Anyone whom this ability fails thrice on dies from mana friction on the soul.</HVT_TransSphinxFantasy>
<HVT_TransThunderbirdFantasy>Once a quadrum, {PAWN_pronoun} can transform someone into a Latent Sorcerer. If the target is already a Latent Sorcerer, {PAWN_pronoun} has a 33% chance to awaken them instead.</HVT_TransThunderbirdFantasy>
<HVT_TransWraithFantasy>{PAWN_possessive} soul is no longer bound to {PAWN_possessive} body. Should {PAWN_pronoun} be slain, {PAWN_pronoun} will forcibly and automatically possess another individual somewhere in the world, overriding their traits, faction, and thoughts. This preferrentially selects those not belonging to one's own faction in the same map or caravan.\n\nBeing struck by an enchanted weapon will prevent {PAWN_objective} from using this ability for the next day.</HVT_TransWraithFantasy>
<HVT_TransZizFantasy>{PAWN_pronoun} can call down pillars of astral energy, destroying armies or even entire settlements. It takes {PAWN_objective} a while to gather the power required to do so, but it occurs quicker while {PAWN_pronoun} meditates.</HVT_TransZizFantasy>
