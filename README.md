# HautsAddedTraits
This is a RimWorld mod, as available on Steam at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3422847391

Adds a ridiculous amount of traits to RimWorld, most of which have unique mechanics. Includes traits specific to RimWorld's various DLCs, as well as genes that correspond to some of the traits, a "tree" of psychic traits that evolve through distinct tiers that grant psycast levels and unique powers, and a lot of compatibility with other mods.

|==== Patch notes ====|

These are here in the GitHub README rather than the Steam description because they contain spoilers for Skulker Events and transcendences, which I would really prefer you learn about through the course of play: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jLvy0yWXAKvogvb-y-sxlZylJt6sh1mE0hgibm2FFL0/edit?usp=sharing
